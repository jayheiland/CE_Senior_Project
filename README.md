## Our Project: An Analog Synthesizer with a Digital Interface
### Meeting Logs
We've kept a [record of our meetings](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/Meeting%20logs.pdf) for future reference.
### Prototype Synth
Here is the [schematic](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/schematic.PNG) and [board](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/Board.pdf) used in our [prototype synth](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/IMG_0136.jpg). This schematic of the prototype's [triangle to sine wave converter](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/triangleToSine.png) shows which resistors control which qualities of our output sine wave.
