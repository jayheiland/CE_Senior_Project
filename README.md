# Our Project: An Analog Synthesizer with a Digital Interface

## Project Log
Our weekly progress from August 2019 onwards.


### Week 5 (September 20 - September 26)
* All: Worked on troubleshooting VCA 1
* Michelle:
* Aros:
* Jay:

### Week 4 (September 13 - September 19)
* All:
* Michelle:
* Aros:
* Jay: VCO 2 works on a breadboard. It outputs a triangle wave and a sawtooth wave, and has a volt/octave scaling feature.

### Week 3 (September 6 - September 12)
* All: Reviewed Aros's Eagle schematic for VCA 1.
* Michelle: Ordered components for VCA. Reviewed workings of digipots and rotary encoders; reviewed I2C protocol.
* Aros:
* Jay: Reviewed digipot/encoder usage in modules with Michelle. Worked on troubleshooting VCO 1, but could not get it properly working. Ordered parts for a new VCO module, VCO 2.

### Week 2 (August 30 - September 5)
* All:
* Michelle: Ordered Eurorack case, and MIDI-to-CV converter module.
* Aros:
* Jay:

### Week 1 (August 22 - August 29)
* All:
* Michelle: 
* Aros:
* Jay: Finished breadboarding a simple Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO). It produces a saw-tooth wave and could potentially be moved to a PCB and used in our final synth. Continuing to troubleshoot VCO 1, which has more features such as Volt/Octave scaling.

## Prototype Synth
Here is the [schematic](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/schematic.PNG) and [board](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/Board.pdf) used in our [prototype synth](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/IMG_0136.jpg). This schematic of the prototype's [triangle to sine wave converter](https://github.com/jayheiland/CE_Senior_Project/blob/master/docs/triangleToSine.png) shows which resistors control which qualities of our output sine wave.
