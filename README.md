# Our Project: An Analog Synthesizer with a Digital Interface

## Project Overview
The goal of this senior project was to take
the best parts of both digital and analog synths and
combine them into a working, scalable prototype for an
analog synth with digital control. The core components of
this project consist of a software application, synthesizer
modules, and the software and hardware interfaces
between them. On Demo Day we were able to show off
the most important and core parts of our project, which
could be scaled to a much larger product.

## Project Structure
 - "app src" contains the source files for the supporting desktop app.
 - "docs" contains our final report. Context for this project and all citations can be found within the final report.
 - "embedded src" contains all embedded project files for our *STM32F072 Discovery* microcontroller.
 - "schematics" contains the design files for our printed circuit board and acrylic panels, plus a supporting .als (Ableton Live Session) file for processing musical keyboard input into MIDI output.
